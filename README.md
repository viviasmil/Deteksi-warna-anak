# 🎨 Color Detection for Kids Using Computer Vision 🧠📷

Welcome to an interactive and educational computer vision project built with ❤️ for children!  
This application leverages the power of **Python** and **OpenCV** to detect basic colors in real-time through a webcam, helping young children recognize and learn colors in a fun and engaging way.

## 🌟 Overview

Color is one of the first concepts children begin to learn and identify in early education. This project introduces an innovative way to support that learning process by using **computer vision**. Through a live camera feed, the system detects colors like red, green, blue, and yellow, and visually labels them in real time. It is especially helpful for parents, teachers, and caregivers who want to introduce technology-based learning in a playful manner.
